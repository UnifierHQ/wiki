# Unifier Micro (older versions)

<Info>
This guide is for **Unifier Micro v2 and older**. If you're installing a newer version of Unifier Micro, consult the [modern guide](unifier-micro.md) instead.
</Info>

## Requirements

### Minimum system requirements

<Warning>
Memory requirements will depend on many factors such as but not limited to cached messages and number of servers the bot is in.
</Warning>

<Info>
Unifier Micro can be installed on Python 3.13.0rc2 and newer but has the following caveat:

* Nextcord in some cases cannot be installed using user installation. In this case, it must either be installed on a virtualenv or globally.

Please note that this is for advisory purposes only and we will remove this note as soon as we learn the above issues have been patched.
</Info>

Unifier Micro requires the following:

* 64-bit CPU that can run Python 3.8 or newer
* At least 50MB of available RAM, meaning excluding RAM already being used by the system and other apps
* An internet connection
* Python 3.8 or newer

### Recommended system requirements

We recommend the following for Unifier:

* 64-bit CPU based on x86\_64 or ARM64 that can run Python 3.11 or newer
* 15 Mbps or faster internet connection
* Python 3.11 or newer

### Dependencies

Unifier Micro requires the following modules to run:

* `novus` 0.2.4 or newer (discord.py and other versions may run with modifications)
* `python-dotenv`

## Installation

Other than dependencies, Unifier Micro requires no installation process, just like it's full-scale version. It is ready to be run out-of-the-box, with no compilation needed.

<Info>
We do not provide Docker containers or anything similar. By "out-of-the-box", we mean that its source code can be ran in whatever system with very little to no extra steps.
</Info>

## Configuration

A base `config.json` file should have been provided to you. This configuration is near identical to our `config.json` file on the official instance, so it can serve as a good template.

Unifier Micro has a much simplified configuration process, so you only need to set up the owner ID, admin IDs, prefix, and bot token.

### Set bot token

To log in to Discord, Unifier needs to connect to a bot account. By giving it a token, it gives Unifier a "password" to log in to that account.

<Danger>
**WARNING:** Do **NOT** share this token to anyone you don't trust, not even us!
</Danger>

<Info>
As of Unifier and Unifier Micro v1.1.8, tokens in config files are **no longer supported**. You will have to use .env files.
</Info>

Create a `.env` (dotenv) file, then add your token as the value for the `TOKEN` key. Your .env file should look like this:

```text .env
TOKEN=TH0U5H411N0TP455
```

This file should be EXACTLY named `.env`, not `.env.txt`, `.env.json`, just `.env`, nothing more.

### Assigning Unifier Micro admins

You can assign admins by adding their user IDs in the `admin_ids` list in `config.json`. By assigning admins, you grant them the ability to manage rooms and moderators.

As Unifier Micro does not have Revolt or Guilded support capabilities, only integers should be used as IDs.

<Info>
Admins **do not** have access to admin.py commands, only certain config.py commands.
</Info>

## Running Unifier Micro

You can run Unifier Micro on whatever system that supports Python 3.8 or newer and Unifier Micro's dependencies. If you're self-hosting and running Unifier Micro through the shell (bash, zsh, etc), we recommend you use the `screen` package (this is NOT a Python library) so you can keep it running in the background, even after closing the shell.

<Warning>
Windows users may not be able to use `screen`. Please find an alternative way to run Unifier Micro in the background, or use a server.
</Warning>

But before you run the bot, we recommend you add it to your **home server** (where the logging channels are located in). You can do this by copying your bot's client ID, then going to `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<client_id>&permissions=537259008&scope=bot`. Remember to replace `<client_id>` with the bot's client ID!

### Self-hosted

First, open a `screen` instance by running `screen -S unifier`. This will open an empty shell. Then, change the screen's directory to wherever Unifier Micro is located by running `cd ./path/to/dir`, with `./path/to/dir` being the path of wherever you installed Unifier Micro. If Unifier Micro is located in a folder called `unifier` which is conveniently in the same folder that your shell is in, then you can run `cd ./unifier`.

Once you have done that, run `python3 microfier.py` to run Unifier Micro. If it's running properly, then congratulations!

<Info>
You can manage the screen by running `screen -Dr unifier`.
</Info>

<Warning>
Unifier Micro does **not** have a graceful shutdown command. To shutdown the bot, please Ctrl+C the process, or exit the screen using `screen -X -S unifier quit`.
</Warning>

### Managed

<Info>
This is a guide for the **Pterodactyl panel**, as many free hosting services use this panel. If your hosting service uses a different panel, please contact them for assistance.

Additionally, this part of the guide assumes you have created a server already. If you haven't, please create a Python server.
</Info>

As Unifier Micro already has a requirements.txt file, you do not need to modify anything else except the App PY file and Python version. These options can be found in the **Startup** page.

Change the App PY file value to `microfier.py`, and the Python version to Python 3.8 or later. We recommend using Python 3.11.

Once you have done that, you can return to the **Console**, then press **Start** to start Unifier Micro. If it's running properly, then congratulations!

## Further setup

### Assigning moderators

To help keep your chat clean, Unifier lets you add moderators that can delete messages and temporarily or permanently ban users from Unified Chat. Admins can assign them by running `u!addmod @user`, or unassign them by running `u!removemod @user`. The changes will be reflected in `data.json` automatically.

### Making a room

Unified Chat depends on "rooms". If you send something in a channel linked to the `main` room, they will be sent to all other channels linked to the same room.

Rooms can be created by admins only. To create a room, run `u!make <room>`. You can add rules using `u!addrule <room> <rule>`, lock authors to admins only using `u!roomlock <room>`, and restrict people who can connect to your room to admins only by using `u!roomrestrict <room>`.

Congratulations, your Unifier instance is ready to go! Follow the [Getting started for the official instance](../../setup/getting-started/) to connect your servers.
