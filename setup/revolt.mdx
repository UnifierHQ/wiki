<Danger>
This guide assumes that your Unifier instance has the correct Platform Support Modifier installed (for Revolt, use the [Revolt Support Modifier](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier-revolt)) and the command signatures of the platform is the same as Revolt Support's.

Please reach out to your instance owner for assistance if needed.
</Danger>

<Info>
For this guide, we will use `u!` as the bot prefix, as that is the prefix of the public instance.
</Info>

## Server permissions

First, ensure that your Unifier instance has all the necessary permissions. For it to properly function, it should have:

* **View Channel**\
  Required for detecting messages sent in chat.
* **Send Messages**\
  Required for Unifier to send responses to commands.
* **Send Embeds**\
  Required for embeds, as well as for displaying embeds from bridged messages.
* **Upload Files**\
  Required for displaying attachments from bridged messages.
* **Masquerade**\
  Required for Unifier to apply custom avatars and usernames to each bridged message.
* _**(Optional) Manage Roles**_\
  Required for Unifier to display user colors. If this permission is not given, the user color will be the same as Unifier's.
* _**(Optional) Use external emojis**_\
  Required for displaying user emojis, but not required for bot to function.
* _**(Optional) Manage Messages**_\
  Required for Global Emojis, but not required for basic bridging functionality.

If any of these permissions are missing, **the bot may NOT work in your server**.

## Creating a Private Room

<Info>
If you've already created a Private Room (regardless of the platform you've used), skip to [Connecting to Rooms](#connecting-to-rooms).
</Info>

Unifier lets you create Private Rooms for you and your friends and communities to chat together without having to worry about unwanted servers joining in.

To create a Private Room, simply run `u!bridge create-room` to create a room. Your Room will be given a random name, which Unifier will send through the command response. **This is your Room name, which you can use to manage your Room settings.**

If Private Rooms aren't enabled on your instance, please contact your instance operators for assistance.

### Creating Private Room invites

<Info>
If you're trying to bind the server you created your Private Room in to your Private Room, you don't need a Room invite for this. You will only need it for other servers.

If you're trying to bind to a Public Room, you don't need an invite regardless of the server (hence the "Public").
</Info>

For servers to join your Private Room, you will need to create an invite. You can create an invite by running `u!config create-invite`. You will need to provide the Room name when running the command.

Every invite, by default, is valid for 7 days and has unlimited uses. You can customize these if you wish.

<Warning>
Although permanent invites (i.e. invites that don't expire) are available, they are not enabled by default. If you need this, please ask your instance's owners for assistance.
</Warning>

<Frame caption="private-1s1sxkl1eu is the room name, 3d is the validity of the invite, and 1 is the maximum usage of the invite. "><img src="../assets/images/image%20(30).png" alt="" /></Frame>

Once you run the command, Unifier will create an invite and send it to you through DMs. **This is your invite code.**

If you forget your invites, you can always run `u!config invites <room>` to view your Room's invites. Unifier will DM the Room's invites to you.

## Connecting to rooms

<Info>
To bind to and unbind from rooms, you need **Manage Channel** permission.
</Info>

<Warning>
To connect to a room, you will need a channel for the room. We recommend you create a dedicated channel for the rooms rather than using existing ones.

After creating the channel, please make sure there are no channel permission overrides that **limit** Unifier's permissions (you do not need to check for overrides that **grant** additional permissions to Unifier).
</Warning>

Connecting to a Unifier room is simple and straightforward. You can see what rooms are available to you by running `u!bridge rooms`. If there are no rooms available, contact your instance admins for help.

In the channel you want to bind the Room to, run `u!bridge bind <room>`, where `<room>` is the name of the room you want to connect to, or if the room is a Private Room, an invite code to the Private Room.

<Frame caption="For Public Rooms, type in the Room name."><img src="../assets/images/image%20(15).png" alt="" /></Frame>

<Frame caption="For Private Rooms, type in the Room invite. You can use the Room name if you're running the command in the same server you created the Room in."><img src="../assets/images/image%20(16).png" alt="" /></Frame>

Before you bind the channel to the room, you'll need to accept the rules of the room. On Discord, you will need to press "Agree & Bind" to connect to the room.

Once you have completed your steps, your channel should be connected!

<Warning>
If you're done using an invite, **we strongly recommend you revoke it**. An invite will let any server join your Private Room.

To revoke an invite, run `u!config delete-invite <invite>` where `<invite>` is the invite code.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### The bot won't bridge messages to Revolt!

This is a common issue. Usually, this is because you didn't grant the bot the Masquerade permission. Grant it and try again.
