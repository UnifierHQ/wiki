title: Upgrading Unifier

<Info>
This only applies to **Unifier**. Unifier Micro does not have support for Upgrader or System Manager.

If you use Unifier Micro, you will need to do a manual upgrade, though this should only involve replacing the microfier.py file.
</Info>

You can upgrade your Unifier core and system extensions, as well as Plugins like Revolt Support using the built-in upgrader.

Once a new version of the bot is released, you will be able to upgrade the bot using the `upgrade` command. On some occasions such as but not limited to a Unifier core upgrade, you may need to reboot the bot entirely for the changes to take effect. Unifier will automatically detect if your bot requires a reboot or not post-upgrade.

## Upgrading plugins

To upgrade plugins, you can run the `upgrade [plugin]` command to upgrade the plugin. To get a list of plugins, run the `plugins` command.

Leaving `[plugin]` blank will default the plugin to `system`, which will run a Unifier base (core + system plugins) upgrade. This is the same behavior as the `upgrade` command in Upgrader.

If you use Unifier v1.2.5 or newer or v2.0.1 or newer, you will be able to choose between upgrading to a **Release** version or a **Legacy** version. A Release version is a version of the newest release series (v3 as of last update), while a Legacy version is a version of an older but the same release series your instance currently uses (v2 or v1.2 as of last update).

## Troubleshooting

### The upgrade failed

<Info>
**Are you on v1.2 or v2.0.0-v2.1.7?**

We recently released a patch for v1.2 and v2 that fixes upgrades to v3 failing. Please upgrade to the patch first then retry.

If you use v2, you will need to install the [Emergency Upgrader](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/emergency-upgrader) plugin.
</Info>

No worries! Unifier comes with an auto-rollback system so the core and system extensions can continue running normally. Do note that Unifier will not be able to roll back plugins such as Upgrader and Revolt Support.

If the automatic rollback fails, please perform a [manual rollback](./upgrading/manual-rollback).

### Plugins won't upgrade

You may need to upgrade the core and system plugins first. Run `upgrade` before upgrading the plugin.

### Upgrade command isn't responding

Please check if you have the correct version installed. If you see a "Micro edition" on boot, it means you're using Unifier Micro, which doesn't have support for System Manager/Upgrader or any other add-ons. If you use the full version, check the bot version you are using.

If you are using v1.2.0 or newer, your bot already comes with a System Manager command which allows you to manage base and plugin upgrades. If the command is not responding, try rebooting your bot. If that doesn't help, contact the developers.

If you are using any older version, this is because these versions are no longer supported. We do not provide any support and backwards compatibility for these versions and the Upgrader add-on, and you will need to perform a manual upgrade to a supported version.

### Unifier won't boot after an upgrade

* **"To start the bot, please run "./run.sh" instead."**: From v3, Unifier has a new "bootloader" with many new features. You will need to run `./run.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `./run.bat` (Windows) in the terminal instead of `python3 unifier.py` to run Unifier.
* **Could not load .env file**: If you've upgraded to v1.1.8 or newer from an earlier version, this is because we stopped using tokens in config files and switched to storing them in dotenv files for more security. You can find more info on how to upgrade [here](./unifier#set-bot-token).
* **Not AGPLv3 compliant**: If you've upgraded to v1.1.9 or newer from an earlier version, this is because we included code to make the bot **AGPLv3 compliant**. You can find more info on how to fix this [here](./modding#how-do-i-make-my-source-code-available).

If your issue does not fit in one of these common issues, your bot may be unable to reboot. To solve this, you need to perform a [manual rollback](./upgrading/manual-rollback).

Or, there may be new config keys that you need to configure. Check [here](./unifier#configuration) (or [here](./unifier-micro#configuration) for Micro) to see if you missed any variables.
