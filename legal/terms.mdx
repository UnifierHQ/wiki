## 1. Introduction

Thank you for using Unifier! These Terms of Service is an agreement between UnifierHQ and you, the user, when you use our Unifier instances. By using our Services, you confirm that you have read and agreed to the Terms.

We reserve the right to update the Terms for reasons which includes, but not limited to, complying with the law, complying with the Terms of Service for APIs we use, or adding information on new features. If the updates to the Terms significantly affects how we provide our Services to you, you will be notified prior to the change. Continued use of our services will confirm that you have agreed to the modifications of the Terms unless stated otherwise. If you do not agree to the Terms, please stop using the Services.

**These Terms only applies to UnifierHQ-owned instances.** If you are unsure if we own the instance you are using, refer to the next section.

We'll try to keep the language as simple and human-readable as possible!

### 1.1. Definition of terms

There's some terms we'll use to simplify things, we've listed them here. You can treat this as some sort of a glossary, in case you don't know what we're referring to.

* "you": You, the user of our products.
* "we", "us", "our", or "UnifierHQ": The team here at UnifierHQ.
* "Terms": A Terms of Service (ToS) document, whether that be this one or a self-hosted instance's ToS document.
* "Privacy Policy": Our Privacy Policy document for UnifierHQ-owned Unifier (software) instances.

* "Software": The Unifier software that powers instances.
* "Instance" or "Instances": Unifier instances, such as Unifier (instance) and HQ-Link.

* "Public Instance": Public Unifier instance we operate. It's the "Unifier" instance you see in section 2.
* "External Instance" or "External Instances": Unifier instances that are self-hosted. UnifierHQ has no control over these instances.

* "Platform" or "Platforms": A service operated by another entity that provides real-time communication services, such as Discord.

* "Account" or "Accounts": Your account on any Platforms such as but not limited to Discord and Revolt.

## 2. Scope of the Terms

* **Unifier**
  * Discord: Unifier#6142 (1293976784634646669)

### 2.1. Exclusion of self-hosted Instances

Unifier is free and open source software. We allow anyone to self-host their own External Instances at no cost, as long as they comply with the Software License. We do not have any control over the operation of External Instances, and we do not provide any Services through External Instances.

For these reasons, these Terms **do not apply to External Instances**. Instead, you must refer to the Instance's own Terms. If the External Instance does not have a Terms of Service document, please ask the Instance's owners to provide their own Terms.

## 3. Requirements for using our Services

To use our Services, you must be at least 13 years old **and** over the age of digital consent in your country. If we find that you are under this age, all data associated to you will be deleted to the best of our extent, and we will issue a permanent suspension which you can appeal once you have met the age requirements.

You must also not have any active suspension from Unifier. Any attempts to circumvent this, even accidental ones, will result in a permanent suspension.

You must also agree to our [Community Guidelines](./guidelines), [Privacy Policy](./privacy) and abide by each Room's rules.

## 4. Rooms & Content

All Unifier Instances provide a Bridge Service (i.e. relaying a message from a Server to other Servers or other Platforms). To provide you with the Service, we let you connect to Rooms. Rooms come in two forms: Public Rooms and Private Rooms.

### 4.1. Public Rooms

Public Rooms lets you connect with many communities across various Platforms. Any community can join and leave a Public Room at any time. There are no limits on how many Public Rooms each Server may connect to.

When you post content to a Public Room, you agree that the content will be considered **public information**. All users, regardless of termination status, are granted rights to view your message's content.

### 4.2. Private Rooms

Private Rooms lets you connect with the communities you want without having other communities join in without your approval. On our Official Instances with Private Rooms enabled, each Server is allocated 10 Private Rooms and may connect to up to 20 Private Rooms. If your use case requires more Private Rooms, please contact us to ask for an increase in allocation.

When you post content to a Private Room, we consider the content confidential. However, please note that you are responsible to control who can view the Room's contents and what they can do with the contents.

If you are suspected of misusing our Services on our Official Instances, moderators reserve the rights to connect to your Private Rooms without an invite to take action. This is so we can make sure everyone can use Unifier safely.

### 4.3. Content

When you upload content to a Unifier Instance, you grant us a non-revocable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to:

* **Use, copy, store, modify and distribute your content**
  * We require this to provide basic services such as bridging. We also need the rights to modify your content for purposes such as converting raw mentions to placeholders on external Platforms.
* **Sub-license your content to our partners**
  * We work with third-parties to provide Services, such as Discord and Revolt. To bridge messages to those Platforms, we'd need to grant them a license as well.

Your content will be stored in line with our [Privacy Policy](./privacy). If any of your personal information was shared to an Official Instance without your consent, please contact us immediately (see [8. Contact](#id-8.-contact) for more information).

## 5. Termination

UnifierHQ reserves all rights to terminate you or your community's access to our Services with or without further notice. Reasons for Termination include but are not limited to:

* Your failure to comply with the Terms,
* A Privacy Policy opt-out request you made (Unifier will not collect your data when Termination of Services is in effect), and
* Discontinuation of either the Software or Instances.

Upon Termination, your data will **not be deleted** unless:

* You specifically requested data deletion as part of your opt-out, or
* Your access to our Services was terminated because you did not meet the minimum age requirements in your country.

You agree not to circumvent any Services terminations, both temporary and permanent, that UnifierHQ may impose on you. Failure to do so will result in a permanent termination.

**Please note that UnifierHQ does not have any authority whatsoever to limit or restrict one's access to a Server.** This is completely up to the Server's staff to impose, not us.

### 5.1. Appealing your termination

If your access was terminated due to an error or misunderstanding, you are free to appeal it given that you provide valid reasoning or/and documentation behind your claims. This applies to both temporary and permanent terminations.

Please note that we reserve all rights to deny your appeal or/and prevent you from making any further appeals for any reason, such as but not limited to:

* Invalid or missing documentation in your appeal, or
* A severe violation of the Terms you may have made.

### 5.2. Terminations caused by an unauthorized actor

We follow the principles of "your Account, your responsibility". In other words, it is your responsibility to safeguard your account from third parties, and any rule infractions caused by any party through your Account will still result in warnings or terminations.

### 5.3. Using External Instances after termination from Official Instances

UnifierHQ assumes no control over the operation of External Instances. When you use External Instances, you are bound by their Terms and Privacy Policy, and not ours. If you have been terminated from using Official Instances, you reserve the right to freely use External Instances. However, you may receive limited support from UnifierHQ for any Unifier Instance if you have been terminated.

This also works vice versa - if you've been suspended from an External Instance, you are free to use Official Instances or other External Instances given you have not been suspended from those. If you are not suspended from Official Instances, this will not limit the level of support you receive from us.

## 6. Warranty & Liability

Unifier is provided **as-is**. Although we take a lot of effort into making Unifier as safe as possible, we do not provide any form of warranty or liability should damages occur from the use of any Instance (including both Official Instances and External Instances) of the Software.

It is your responsibility to 1) understand the conditions of both the Terms and Software License before you use a Unifier Instance, and 2) safeguard your assets, communities, etc. from any damage that may be caused by an Instance. For example, you should:

* Never grant Unifier any potentially destructive permissions other than those required for functionality (both required and optional),
* Never expose any secrets (passwords, API keys, etc.) to a public area through Instances, and
* Always double check the command you're running and arguments you're giving it when you're running potentially destructive commands.

Do note that **this does not mean UnifierHQ does not patch security vulnerabilities within Unifier**.

## 7. Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take various measures to ensure that Unifier is safe for everyone to use. However, there still may be gaps in our development process which lead to security vulnerabilities, which may impact either us or our users.

When you report a Security Vulnerability to us, you agree to keep its contents confidential until we give permission to disclose the vulnerability. You agree to report all vulnerabilities privately, such as through our GitHub repository's Security page or through the maintainers' direct messages. Failure to follow these conditions may result in terminations.
