<Warning>
This Privacy Policy only applies to **UnifierHQ-owned instances**. If your instance is not owned by UnifierHQ, refer to the instance's own Privacy Policy.
</Warning>

Effective: 2025/02/17

## 1. Introduction

Thank you for using Unifier! This Privacy Policy is an agreement between UnifierHQ and you, the user, on data we collect when you use our Unifier instances. By using our Services, you confirm that you have read and agreed to this privacy policy. So as many people as possible understand what data we're collecting, we'll keep the language simple.

Just like in our Terms, we reserve the right to update the Policy for reasons which includes, but not limited to, complying with the law, complying with the Terms of Service for APIs we use, or adding information on new features. If the updates to the Policy in some way affects how we collect and use your data, we'll let you know beforehand. Continued use of our services after such notification confirms you have agreed to the modified policy.

**This policy only applies to UnifierHQ-owned instances.** If you are unsure if we own the instance you are using, refer to the next section.

### 1.1. Definition of terms

There's some terms we'll use to simplify things, we've listed them here. You can treat this as some sort of a glossary, in case you don't know what we're referring to.

* "you": You, the user of our products.
* "we", "us", "our", or "UnifierHQ": The team here at UnifierHQ.
* "Terms": A Terms of Service (ToS) document, whether that be this one or a self-hosted instance's ToS document.
* "Privacy Policy": Our Privacy Policy document for UnifierHQ-owned Unifier (software) instances.
* "Services": The bridging service we provide through our Unifier (software) instances.
* "Software": The Unifier software that powers instances.
* "Instance" or "Instances": Unifier instances, such as Unifier (instance) and HQ-Link.
* "Official Instance" or "Official Instances": Unifier instances that we at UnifierHQ own and operate ourselves. A comprehensive list can be found in [2. Scope of the Policy](#id-2.-scope-of-the-policy).
* "Public Instance": Public Unifier instance we operate. It's the "Unifier" instance you see in section 2.
* "External Instance" or "External Instances": Unifier instances that are self-hosted. UnifierHQ has no control over these instances.
* "Software License": The license Unifier (software) is licensed under, which is AGPLv3.
* "Room" or "Rooms": A Unifier Room, where users can send messages and let Unifier bridge it.
* "Platform" or "Platforms": A service operated by another entity that provides real-time communication services, such as Discord.

## 2. Scope of the Policy

We own multiple instances of Unifier, so we can use the project for different use cases we have. We own the following instances:

* **Unifier**
  * Discord: Unifier#6142 (1293976784634646669)
  * Revolt: Unifier#7590 (01J9TVVTZDES7S7QQX5KXXRADB)
* **Unifier Origin**
  * Discord: Unifier Origin#7129 (1187093090415149056)

* **HQ-Link**
  * Discord: HQ-Link#2264 (1257041022068981800)
  * Revolt: HQ-Link#3821 (01J1N6M5A0H5W00KTMCNKBC2VV)

### 2.1. Exclusion of self-hosted Instances

Like we said in our Terms, Unifier is free and open source software. We allow anyone to self-host their own External Instances at no cost, as long as they comply with the Software License. We do not have any control over the operation of External Instances, and we do not provide any Services or collect any data through External Instances.

For these reasons, this Policy **does not apply to External Instances**. Instead, you must refer to the Instance's own Policy. If the External Instance does not have a Privacy Policy document, please ask the Instance's owners to provide their own Policy.

## 3. Data we collect

We collect data both manually and automatically to make our Unifier instances work, but we never collect data for any other reasons than described in section 3 of this Policy.

### 3.1. Data you provide to us (manually collected data)

We do not manually collect any data from you at the moment.

### 3.2. Data we automatically collect

All Unifier instances, UnifierHQ-owned or not, collect data to let the bot function. Unifier collects the following data.

All data listed below are saved encrypted at-rest, unless stated otherwise.

* Discord message IDs
* Discord user IDs
* Discord server IDs
* Discord channel IDs
* Discord webhook IDs

We also collect the following data:

* Revolt message IDs
* Revolt user IDs
* Revolt server IDs
* Revolt channel IDs
* Guilded message IDs (excluding Public Instance)
* Guilded user IDs (excluding Public Instance)
* Guilded server IDs (excluding Public Instance)
* Guilded channel IDs (excluding Public Instance)
* Guilded webhook IDs (excluding Public Instance)
* Message content and simple metadata (including but not limited to **number** of attachments)

### 3.3. Data we access, but never store

We require access to some data to provide our services, but we don't need to store them.

* Detailed message metadata (including but not limited to attachments data, message being replied to)

### 3.4. How we collect your data

All IDs are collected automatically when you send a message in a Unifier Room. For other data types, we've listed how we collect them here.

* **Message content and simple metadata**: We collect this data when one of the two events are triggered.
  * **On message send**: Data of the above type collected on message sends **are not stored**.
  * **On message deletion**: If your message was sent in a Public Room, we store the message content and simple metadata to a moderator log channel on UnifierHQ's Discord server. **This does not apply to Private Rooms.**

## 4. Purpose of collection

### 4.1. How we use your data

We use your data strictly for the intended purposes below:

* **To provide you with the services**: We use your data to make Unifier work. For example, we need to know who sent what, so that we can show the author information in the bridged messages so viewers will know you sent that specific message.
* **To safeguard us, including but not limited to staff and users**: We use your data to ensure that everyone in UnifierHQ, including us as staff and everyone else as community members, are safe when we provide our services. For example, we can use the user ID assigned to a harmful message to prevent the corresponding user from sending any further messages, so that they cannot send such messages to our community again.

### 4.2. Usage of data collected

All processing and storage of data is done **locally** unless otherwise stated. We never share your data to advertisers, analytics companies, etc.

Please do note that some data may be accessible from Platforms outside Discord.

* **Message IDs**: We require this data to identify a parent message (i.e. a message sent by a user in a Unifier room) and its copy messages (i.e. the messages sent by Unifier through webhooks to other servers and Platforms).  This data is stored indefinitely until the parent message is deleted or the message cache reaches its limit (currently 10,000).
* **User and Server IDs**: We require this data to identify the origin of a message, as well as the corresponding user or server of preferences.
* **Channel IDs**: We require this data to identify connected channels, so that we can improve to-Discord bridging performance and provide to-external bridging for Platforms that don't use webhooks (e.g. Revolt).
* **Message content and metadata**: We use this data for two purposes.
  * **For basic service**: We require this data to "bridge" (i.e. relay) your messages to connected Servers and Platforms. **This data is shared to the Platforms but is never stored on the Instances themselves.**
  * **For user and community safety**: We require this data to ensure safety and combat malicious behavior. **This data is accessible from the Platforms but is never stored on the Instances themselves.**

### 4.3. Data retention period

* **User and Server IDs**: This data is stored indefinitely. Some copies of this data cannot be deleted for safety reasons and Policy opt-out compliance.
* **Message IDs**: This data is stored until the parent message is deleted or the Instance's cache limit has been reached. If this limit is reached, older message IDs will not be saved to disk to stay within the limit.

All other data is stored indefinitely until deletion is requested, unless we explicitly state that we do not store the data.

## 5. Disclosure of your data

We only disclose data to third parties (including other Instance users), when:

* We need to share public data that can be accessed by anyone, or
* We are required by law to disclose any data we may have.

## 6. Deleting your data

### 6.1. Request deletion

For most data, you can request deletion through Unifier. For example, you can delete channel IDs from our systems by unbinding a channel.

If you would like to have all data linked to you deleted, please contact us.

### 6.2. Request deletion AND opt-out of all collection

If you would like to opt out of data collection in addition to deletion, please contact us at UnifierHQ. Please do note that we will continue to store your user ID if you opt-out, as we require this data to respect your opt-out status.

After you opt out, we will delete the following data:

* Your preferences, such as avatar and nickname,
* Your bridged message IDs

Please note that we are unable to delete any bridged messages from the Platforms, as the data required to identify bridged copies will be deleted. Please make sure you delete your messages before requesting data deletion.
