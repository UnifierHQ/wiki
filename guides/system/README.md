# Unifier System

{% hint style="warning" %}
These guides are meant for **self-hosted instance maintainers only** unless otherwise stated. You can still read these, but you probably won't need to use them unless you want to host your own Unifier instance.
{% endhint %}

The Unifier System is pretty much the heart and brains of Unifier. It lets Unifier run, handles system extensions and Modifiers, and more.

The Unifier System includes:

* Unifier Core (unifier.py)
* System Manager (cogs/sysmgr.py)
* System utilities (everything in utils)
* Bootloader (everything in boot)
