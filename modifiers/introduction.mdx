A **Modifier** (or Plugin) for Unifier is a package made to extend Unifier's functionality. This can include **bot extensions** (aka **cogs**), which may directly interact with the Discord API as Unifier, or **utility modules**, which may be used by your Modifier or Unifier to do some neat magic.

Some of these Modifiers include [Unifier Revolt Support](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier-revolt), a Modifier that allows Unifier to work on Revolt by managing the Revolt bot instance as well as bridging messages from Revolt to Discord.

## Making a Modifier

To make a Modifier, you can use our [template repository](https://github.com/UnifierHQ/unifier-plugin) to get started. Here, you can find template files for how your Modifier repository should look like, such as but not limited to a **bot extension** file and the **Modifier metadata** file, also known as **plugin.json**.

### Using plugin.json

plugin.json is a file which contains your Modifier's metadata, as well as tells Unifier System Manager what files it needs in order for the Modifier to function. We provide a comprehensive guide on each key in the `README.md` file, so we recommend you read its contents to know how to use the file.

### Services

Your Modifier can offer "Services" that Unifier needs to know your Modifier offers in order for them to function properly, such as content protection and emoji packs.
