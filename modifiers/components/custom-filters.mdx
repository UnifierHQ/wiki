<Info>
Filters replaces the Content Protection service that was deprecated in Unifier 3.8.0 (release 139).
</Info>

The Filters service allows your Modifier to install Filters to a Unifier instance.

## Base Filter code

All Filters must have this base code:

```python filter.py
from utils.base_filter import FilterResult, BaseFilter

class Filter(BaseFilter):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            'custom_filter',
            'Custom Filter',
            'A custom filter.'
        )

    def check(self, message, data) -> FilterResult:
        can_send = True
        return FilterResult(can_send)
```

## Adding Filters to your Modifier

Under the `filters` key in plugin.json, add the filename/filepath of your Filter's code to the array.

## The message data dictionary (message)

For each message being scanned by Filters, Unifier will provide the following data under the messages argument when it calls the check function:

* `author` (string): The message author's user ID
* `bot` (boolean): Whether the message author is a bot or not
* `webhook_id` (string): The webhook ID of the message, if applicable
* `content` (string): The message content
* `files` (integer): The number of files in the message
* `suspected_spammer` (boolean): Whether Discord has flagged the user's account or not (**New in 3.9.4/rel148**)

## The Filter data dictionary (data)

For each Filter, Unifier stores some data such as data stored by the Filter and configuration values. Unifier will provide the following data under the data argument:

* `config` (dictionary): The configuration values of the Filter
* `data` (dictionary): Temporary data stored by the Filter
* `global` (boolean): Whether the Filter is called because it was globally enabled (if this is false, it means it was called because it is enabled by the Room)

## Responding to Filter calls

For every Filter call, Unifier will expect the Filter to return a `FilterResult` object. This is available under `utils.base_filter`.

The object's constructor requires the following positional arguments:

* `allowed` (boolean): Whether the message should be allowed or not

You may also provide the following optional keyword arguments:

* `data` (dictionary): Temporary Filter data to store to Unifier (there is no fixed format for this)
* `message` (string): The message that should be shown to the user if `allowed` is False and `should_log` is True
* `should_log` (boolean): Whether the Filter trigger (i.e. `allowed` is False) should be logged or not
* `should_contribute` (boolean): Whether the Filter trigger should contribute to the [Automatic UAM](../../guides/bridge/under-attack-mode.md#automatic-uam) threshold

## Compatibility

Modifiers offering Emojis service should have a minimum Unifier release requirement of **144** or above.
